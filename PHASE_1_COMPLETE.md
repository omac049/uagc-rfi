## 💡 HIGH-IMPACT STRATEGIES THAT WORKED

### **1. Verbose Visual Flows → Compact Summaries** (228 lines saved)
**What:** Each competitor had 75-85 line detailed step-by-step visual flows for program selection
**Solution:** Condensed to 20-line compact reference cards
**Reduction:** 55-65 lines per competitor × 4 = 228 lines

### **2. Detailed Tables → Summary Boxes** (163 lines saved)
**What:** Data Fields tables with 4 columns (Field/Type/Required/Purpose)
**Solution:** Compact summary boxes with key info only
**Reduction:** 26-58 lines per table × 4 = 163 lines

### **3. Verbose Lists → Compact Summaries** (199 lines saved)
**What:** Strengths/Weaknesses with detailed explanatory text for each point
**Solution:** Compact summaries with key terms only
**Reduction:** 45-54 lines per competitor × 4 = 199 lines

### **4. Redundant GA4 Data → References** (76 lines saved)
**What:** Multiple sections displaying same GA4 metrics
**Solution:** Show once in Executive Summary, reference elsewhere
**Reduction:** 11-35 lines per instance
